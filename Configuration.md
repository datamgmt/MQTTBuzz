# Configuring MQTTBuzz

To configure MQTTBuzz, follow these steps:

## Configure the application

You can configure and update the settings directly from the UI:

 * Click on the MQTTBuzz icon in the macOS toolbar.
 * Select Settings.
 * A window will open with the current configuration in JSON format.
 * Edit the configuration as needed and click OK to save.

Note: Make sure the edited JSON is valid. An error will be displayed if the configuration is invalid.

Configuration Parameters

In the mqtt_servers section:

 * mqtt_broker: The address of the MQTT broker.
 * mqtt_port: The port number of the MQTT broker (default is 1883).
 * mqtt_topic: The topic to subscribe to.
 * username: The username for MQTT broker authentication (if required).
 * password: The password for MQTT broker authentication (if required).
 * header: Optional. The title for notifications (defaults to the broker name if not provided).
 * subheader: Optional. The subtitle for notifications (defaults to the topic name if not provided).
 * broker_enabled: Boolean. Whether this broker is enabled (default is true). This allows an individual broker to be turned off without removing the entire configuration 
 * sounds_enabled: Boolean. Whether to enable sound for notifications for the specific broker (default is true).
 * filter: Type of message filtering:
     * "none": Default No filtering, all messages are sent as notifications.
     * "dedup": Deduplicates messages, only sending notifications for new messages.
     * "throttle": Throttles notifications, limiting the frequency based on filter_time.
 * filter_time: Time in seconds for filtering (applicable for dedup and throttle).

Global parameters:

 * sounds_enabled: Boolean. This enables sounds for the entire application. For a sound to be heard both the global parameter and the broker-specific parameter need to be true
 * max_message_length: The maximum length of payload to be displayed. Longer payload will be truncated to this length - defaults to 256 characters

            "filter_time": 10   # 10 seconds deduplication window
        },
        {
            "mqtt_broker": "broker3.example.com",
            "mqtt_port": 1883,
            "mqtt_topic": "kitchen/fridge/door",
            "username": "user3",
            "password": "password3",
            "sound_name": "Ping",
            "header": "Kitchen",
            "subheader": null,  # Will default to the mqtt_topic value
            "broker_enabled": true,
            "sounds_enabled": false,
            "filter": "throttle",  # Throttle messages
            "filter_time": 5  # 5 seconds throttle window
        }
    ],
    "sounds_enabled": true,
    "max_message_length": 256
}
```

## Understanding Filtering

There are three types of filter

 * None - no filter is applied, all messages are passed through
 * Dedup - if a message from a specific broker/topic combination is the same as the previous message and within filter_time seconds then it is filtered
 * Throttle - if a message arrives and then any more messages arrive within filter_time seconds the subsequent messages are ignored regardless of content
 
# Configuring MQTT

Using any MQTT publishing tool e.g. [NodeRed](https://nodered.org) write a message to an MQTT boker and topic. The message payload should be the formated plain text that you want the notification to display e.g. for our aircraft monitoring app the message payload is:

```
G-115 E Tutor BTNIA10
Speed: 97.9mph, Range: 3 miles
Bearing: 142Â°, Height: 1525ft.
```
